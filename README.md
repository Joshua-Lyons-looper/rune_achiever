# rune_achiever
Rune achiever is designed to get a character's skills, quests, and additional requirements to let the player know
which **Achievement Diaries** can be done given their current quests, and letting them know which requirements are missing
to complete more diaries.  The results will be sorted from CAN COMPLETE -> Lowest missing Requirements -> Most missing requirements.
If we are missing the requirements for easy, then medium -> Elite won't be listed.
